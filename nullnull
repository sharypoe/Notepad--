Tuesdays with Morrie is a book written by Mitch Albom, an American author, and a
former Brandeis University student. The book is a narrative based on the author's reconnection
with his former sociology professor from Brandeis University, Morrie Schwartz, who was dying
of a terminal disease. The lessons shared between the two men influence the reader's perspective
on death, wellness, and other health-related topics.
